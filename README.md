# Bustour-Project-Driver
This was one of my first large projects that I have started. It's an Android app that tracks bus trips by subscribing 
to the driver's feed. This app is the driver side that could add users. 
* Note
This might contain API keys in Git *I didn't know about that back then :), uncompleted-code, bugs etc...
It also used Firebase's old APIs so I'm not sure if it still works.
I just thought I should add it here because it was on a private repo on Bitbucket and I thought it's time to open-source it.
This project was also a collaboration between me and two other friends as a summer project.
The other client app is the another app but from the clients side.
